# Irish-Population-Changes

### Overview

Parking spaces in Ireland are notoriously small. If you drive a larger vehicle, you may spend countless minutes trying to fit your car into small spaces or finding the few spaces in the parking lot/garage that are big enough to fit you vehicle. In the worst cases, you may get a parking ticket for infringing on the flow of traffic.

But what motivates people to drive larger vehicles? One hypothesis is family size. If your family size is 5 people or more, you need multiple cars or a larger vehicle to accommodate your whole family. Owning a larger vehicle has its advantages -- your entire family can travel within one car, saving money on petrol and insurance. If you're a parent, you can now bring home your children's friends for play-dates after school, or ferry the neighborhood kids home as a parent car pool. In essence, there are many social opportunities that open up for 5+ person families when they have a larger car.

Given the family hypothesis for driving a larger vehicle, I'd like to understand what the population trends are in Ireland to understand changes in family size, as well as commuter habits. With this information, I hope to have a better idea of whether or not County Councils should consider creating larger parking spaces in public areas. 

### Research Questions

1) What are the changes in family size over time? (e.g., household size 5+ people)
2) What are the patterns of car commuting?
